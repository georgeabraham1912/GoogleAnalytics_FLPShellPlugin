##Google Analytics FLP Shell Plugin##
-------------------------------------

Once an SAP UI5 app is deployed, you would probably like to know the page usage analytics and one of the easiest way to do it is to link 
to an existing Google Analytics account.

Once you set up your Google Analytics account and link your FLP base URL to it, you will get a Tracking ID.

This ID needs to be configured in the Shell Plugin on FLP and then you are good to go.

Once you user starts using the app, your Google Analytics dashboard will have all the details, demographics, etc captured.

NOTE: Details on how to deploy and configure a Shell Plugin is available in the document "SCP - FLP - Deploying and Configuring Shell Plugin" available on the Incture Sharepoint (Incture UI CoE)
